#### Procedure

1. In order to start the experiment, Read the instructions and theory very carefully.<br>
2. Attempt all the pretest questions and then click on the "Simulation" tab. <br>
3. Having clicked the "Simulation", you will be redirected to Simulator. The landing page will consist of: <br>
<strong> A. Demo: Linear search </strong> <br>
<strong> B. Simulator and </strong> <br>
<strong> C. Execution </strong> <br>
4. Start with the Demo box. Here you will know, how the simulator step by step works. <br> 
(i) You have to enter the value in the textfield of "Element to be searched" and then click on the Start button.Having clicked on the start button, you will able to see the simulator is dynamically searches that particular element throughout the array and finally prints the result. <br>
(ii) On the same, you have been given a reset button, by pressing it, you can clear the textfield and dynamic array and finally you can start the process again.<br>
5. Moving further towards the Simulator box. All you have to select one checkbox at a time and after that you have to enter the values. Lets understand it with an example. <br>
For example: <br> (i) If you check the first checkbox, then your first textfield will be enabled and along with that, you will also get the python code highlighted simultaneously in the Execution box which is running at that time. <br> 
(ii) Similarly you have to check all 3 checkboxes of the Simulator one by one and enter valid data inside the textfields. <br>
(iii) If you accidentally put some invalid data (an alphabet, decimal value or any other special character) in the text field, then you will get an error message immediately.And you won't be able to move further.<br>
(iv) After selecting all the checkboxes and entering the data in all the textfields, you have to click on the "Search Element" Button. <br> 
(v) Having clicked on the "Search Element" Button. You will able to see whether the element is found at any index or not or error message in case of any invalid data. Along with that, you will also see the code running in the Execution box at each step. <br>
(vi) On the same, you have been given a reset button, by pressing it, you can clear all the entries and finally you can start the process again.
