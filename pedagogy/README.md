#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| To describe linear search algorithm. | <br> read theory concepts | 1 Where can Linear Search be performed? <br> A. on numbers <br> B. on letters <br> <b>C. on both </b> <br>  D. none of these  <br>2 A linear search algorithm is also known as <br> A. Binary search algorithm <br> B. Bubble sort algorithm <br> <b> C. Sequential search algorithm <br> </b>  <br>
2.| To analyze the complexity of linear search algorithm. | analyze the algorithm <br> | 1 How many linear searches will it take to find the value 7 in the list [1,4,8,7,10,28]? <br> A. 2 <br> B. 3 <br> <b> C. 4 </b> <br>  D. 5  <br> 
3.| To identify an element from given list of Array. | analyze the algorithm <br> | 1 What will happen in a Linear search algorithm if no match is found? <br> A. It continues to search in a never ending loop.  <b> B. "Item not found" is returned </b> <br>   <br>

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will insert total no of elements in an array. <br>  <br>  | Simulator takes input from user. <br>   | to insert total no of elements in an array.
2.| Student will insert elements in that array. <br>  <br>  | Simulator takes input from user. <br>   | to insert elements in that array.
3.| Student will insert element to be searched in that array. <br>  <br>  | Simulator takes input from user. <br>   | inserted element will be searched.
4.| Student will see output. <br>  <br>  | Simulator displays output on screen. <br>  | that element will be searched in that aaray using linear search and produce result.
