#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will be able to know the linear search algorithm. | <br> Read theory concepts | Q. Where can linear search be performed ? <br> A. On numbers <br> B. On letters <br> <b> C. On both </b> <br>  D. None of these  <br> Q. A linear search algorithm is also known as- <br> A. Binary search algorithm <br> B. Bubble sort algorithm <br> <b> C. Sequential search algorithm <br> </b>  <br>
2.| Student will be able to analyze the complexity of linear search algorithm. | Analyze the algorithm <br> | Q. How many linear searches will it take to find the value 7 in the list [1,4,8,7,10,28]? <br> A. 2 <br> B. 3 <br> <b> C. 4 </b> <br> D. 5  <br> 
3.| Student will be able to identify the status of the element from given list of array | Analyze the algorithm <br> |Q. What will happen in a Linear search algorithm if no match is found? <br> A. It continues to search in a never ending loop. <b> B. "Item not found" is returned </b> <br>   <br>

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will insert total number of elements in an array. <br>  <br>  | Simulator will take the input from user. <br>   | To insert total number of elements in the array.
2.| Student will insert elements in that array. <br>  <br>  | Simulator will take the input from user. <br>   | To insert elements in that array.
3.| Student will insert element to be searched in that array. <br>  <br>  | Simulator will take input from user. <br>   | To search the inserted element in the array.
4.| Student will see the output. <br>  <br>  | Simulator will display the output on screen. <br>  | To display the searched element (if any) in that array using linear search.
