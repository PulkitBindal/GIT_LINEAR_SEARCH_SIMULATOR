<b> Lab | <b> Python Language Programming Lab
<b> Experiment|     <b> 1.To write a python program linear search

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

This lab is about the programming language python. Python is a scripting language. In this lab student will learn how to write program for searching techniques (linear and binary search), various sorting algorithms (selection, insertion and merge sort) and some other programs i.e. to print first n prime numbers and to simulate bouncing ball in Pygame.
   

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

Linear search is a very simple and basic search algorithm, also known as a sequential search, is a method of finding an element within a list. It checks each element of the list sequentially until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

All the under graduate students of computer related streams from various engineering colleges and universities.

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

Students have learning objective to write above python programs with the learning activity of having these executable program and assessment will be done based on program's output.

<h5> Universities Mapped : </h5>

Mapped By AKTU Virtual Cell.
